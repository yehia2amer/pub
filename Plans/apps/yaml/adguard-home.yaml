Overview: "AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After\
  \ you set it up, it\u2019ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don\u2019t need\
  \ any client-side software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected\
  \ devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to control your whole network."
