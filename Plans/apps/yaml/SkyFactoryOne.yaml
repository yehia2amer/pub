Overview: "SkyFactory One Modded Minecraft Server[br]The new ultimate skyblock modpack!\
  \ Watch development at: darkosto.tv/SkyFactoryOneLive[br]It's skyblock like you've\
  \ never seen it before... Or have you?! High tech mods, automation, and spawning\
  \ in the void with nothing but a tree and a single piece of dirt between you and\
  \ certain death![br]SkyFactory\xAE One is a modernization of the original SkyFactory\
  \ for Minecraft 1.6.4. The goal of this project is to remain true to the original\
  \ modpack while updating features and mods to 1.16.5. Find yourself sieving for\
  \ resources, twerk for trees, decorate your trophy room, exploring a deep, dark\
  \ dimension, and much more! Many original mods have returned joined by several new\
  \ and updated mods! And what would SkyFactory be without ForceCraft, a reconstruction\
  \ of the original DartCraft mod.[br]SkyFactory One delivers a nostalgic experience\
  \ with the quality of life upgrades to make it even more exciting! If you've never\
  \ played SkyFactory before, prepare for a fresh experience in a modded skyblock.\
  \ The original can never be replaced, but we can sure try!"
